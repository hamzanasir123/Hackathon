# Introduction to ROS2 Architecture

The Robot Operating System 2 (ROS2) provides a flexible framework for writing robot software. It is a collection of tools, libraries, and conventions that aim to simplify the task of creating complex and robust robot behavior across a wide variety of robot platforms.

## Core Concepts

ROS2 is built on several core concepts that enable distributed computing and communication between different components of a robotic system.

### Nodes

Nodes are the fundamental building blocks of a ROS2 system. Each node is a process that performs a specific function and communicates with other nodes through topics, services, or actions.

```python
import rclpy
from rclpy.node import Node

class MinimalPublisher(Node):

    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__('minimal_publisher')
        self.publisher_ = self.create_publisher(String, 'topic', 10)
        timer_period = 0.5  # seconds
        self.timer = self.create_timer(timer_period, self.timer_callback)
        self.i = 0

    def timer_callback(self):
        msg = String()
        msg.data = 'Hello World: %d' % self.i
        self.publisher_.publish(msg)
        self.get_logger().info('Publishing: "%s"' % msg.data)
        self.i += 1
```

### Topics and Messages

Topics are named buses over which nodes exchange messages. Messages are the data structures that are passed between nodes.

:::note
Topics enable asynchronous communication between nodes, making the system robust and scalable.
:::

### Services and Actions

Services provide synchronous request/response communication, while actions provide asynchronous goal-oriented communication with feedback.

```cpp
// Example service request
service_client->async_send_request(request);
```

## Communication Patterns

ROS2 supports several communication patterns:

- **Publish/Subscribe**: One-to-many communication
- **Request/Response**: Synchronous communication
- **Action**: Goal-oriented communication with feedback

## Quality of Service (QoS)

ROS2 introduces Quality of Service settings that allow fine-tuning of communication behavior:

- Reliability: Best effort or reliable
- Durability: Volatile or transient local
- History: Keep last or keep all

:::tip
Use reliable QoS settings for critical data like sensor readings, and best effort for high-frequency data like camera images.
:::

## Implementation Considerations

When implementing ROS2 systems, consider:

1. **Modularity**: Design nodes to have single responsibilities
2. **Performance**: Choose appropriate QoS settings
3. **Robustness**: Handle connection and disconnection events
4. **Security**: Implement authentication and encryption when needed

## Summary

ROS2 provides a robust foundation for developing complex robotic systems through its distributed architecture and communication patterns. Understanding these core concepts is essential for effective robot software development.

:::caution
Always consider the network topology and resource constraints when designing ROS2 systems for deployment on real robots.
