# Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

Welcome to Module 1 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics course. This module introduces you to the Robot Operating System (ROS 2), which serves as the nervous system for robotic platforms. ROS 2 provides the communication infrastructure, tools, and libraries necessary to build complex robotic applications.

## Overview

In this module, you will learn about:

- The architecture and concepts of ROS 2
- Nodes, topics, services, and actions
- Message passing and communication patterns
- Tools for debugging and visualization
- Best practices for ROS 2 development
- How to describe robots using URDF (Unified Robot Description Format)

## Learning Objectives

After completing this module, you will be able to:

- Design and implement ROS 2 nodes for robotic applications
- Create custom message types and services
- Use ROS 2 tools for debugging and monitoring
- Implement communication patterns for robotic systems
- Apply best practices for ROS 2 development
- Describe robot models using URDF

## Module Structure

This module is organized into three main chapters:

### Chapter 1: Foundations of ROS 2 – Architecture and Core Concepts

This chapter covers the fundamental concepts of ROS 2, including its architecture, nodes, topics, messages, parameters, and launch files.

- [Foundations of ROS 2 – Architecture and Core Concepts](./foundations-of-ros2-architecture)

### Chapter 2: Building and Communicating with ROS 2 Nodes in Python

This chapter covers hands-on tutorials for creating ROS 2 nodes using Python and rclpy, including publishers, subscribers, services, and actions.

- [Building and Communicating with ROS 2 Nodes in Python](./building-ros2-nodes-python)
- [Creating Publishers and Subscribers](./creating-publishers-subscribers)
- [Implementing Services and Actions](./implementing-services-actions)
- [Package Building Tutorial](./package-building-tutorial)

### Chapter 3: Describing Humanoid Robots with URDF

This chapter explains how to use the Unified Robot Description Format (URDF) to describe humanoid robots for simulation and control.
