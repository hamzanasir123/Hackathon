# Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

This module introduces you to the Robot Operating System (ROS 2), which serves as the nervous system for robotic platforms. ROS 2 provides the communication infrastructure, tools, and libraries necessary to build complex robotic applications.

## Overview

In this module, you will learn about:

- The architecture and concepts of ROS 2
- Nodes, topics, services, and actions
- Message passing and communication patterns
- Tools for debugging and visualization
- Best practices for ROS 2 development

## Learning Objectives

After completing this module, you will be able to:

- Design and implement ROS 2 nodes for robotic applications
- Create custom message types and services
- Use ROS 2 tools for debugging and monitoring
- Implement communication patterns for robotic systems
- Apply best practices for ROS 2 development

## Topics Covered

1. [Introduction to ROS 2 Architecture](./introduction-to-ros2-architecture)
2. [Nodes and Communication Patterns](./nodes-and-communication-patterns)
