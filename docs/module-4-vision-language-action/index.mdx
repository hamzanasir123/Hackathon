# Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)

This advanced module focuses on the integration of vision, language, and action systems in humanoid robots. We'll explore how these three modalities work together to enable sophisticated human-robot interaction and complex task execution.

## Overview

In this module, you will learn about:

- Vision-language models for robotic applications
- Multimodal perception and understanding
- Language-guided robotic action
- Human-robot interaction and communication
- End-to-end learning for VLA systems

## Learning Objectives

After completing this module, you will be able to:

- Implement vision-language models for robotic perception
- Design language-guided action systems
- Create multimodal interfaces for human-robot interaction
- Develop end-to-end trainable VLA systems
- Evaluate and optimize VLA system performance

## Topics Covered

1. [Introduction to Vision-Language-Action Systems](./introduction-to-vla)
2. [Multimodal Perception](./multimodal-perception)
3. [Language-Guided Action](./language-guided-action)
