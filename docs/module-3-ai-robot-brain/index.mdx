# Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)

Welcome to Module 3 of the Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics course. This module focuses on leveraging the NVIDIA Isaac platform for advanced perception, photorealistic simulation, synthetic data generation, hardware-accelerated robotics pipelines, Visual SLAM (VSLAM), navigation, and path planning tailored to bipedal humanoid robots.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Understand the NVIDIA Isaac ecosystem including Isaac Sim and Isaac ROS
- Explain photorealistic simulation with Omniverse and domain randomization
- Implement Isaac ROS GEMs for accelerated perception (VSLAM, stereo vision, depth processing)
- Configure hardware-accelerated pipelines on NVIDIA GPUs/Jetsons
- Integrate RealSense and LiDAR data processing in Isaac ROS workflows
- Build perception pipelines for object detection, segmentation, and pose estimation in humanoid contexts
- Configure Nav2 stack specifically for bipedal humanoid navigation
- Explain global and local costmaps for dynamic environments with bipedal constraints
- Integrate perception outputs into navigation systems
- Test humanoid navigation in complex simulated indoor scenarios
- Apply best practices for sim-to-real navigation transfer

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:

- Completed Module 1 (The Robotic Nervous System - ROS 2)
- Completed Module 2 (The Digital Twin - Gazebo & Unity)
- Intermediate Python programming skills
- Basic understanding of deep learning concepts
- Familiarity with simulation environments from previous modules

## Module Structure

This module is organized into three main chapters:

1. **Chapter 1: Overview of NVIDIA Isaac Platform and Isaac Sim** - Introduction to the Isaac ecosystem, photorealistic simulation, domain randomization, and sim-to-real transfer techniques.

2. **Chapter 2: Advanced Perception with Isaac ROS and Hardware Acceleration** - Deep dive into Isaac ROS GEMs for perception, hardware acceleration, and sensor integration.

3. **Chapter 3: Navigation and Path Planning for Bipedal Humanoids with Nav2** - Configuring Nav2 for humanoid-specific navigation and integrating perception with navigation.

## What You'll Build

Throughout this module, you'll work with four progressively complex Isaac Sim examples:

1. Basic Asset Loading - Load humanoid robot model in Isaac Sim
2. Sensor-Equipped Humanoid - Add sensors to the humanoid model
3. Perception Pipeline - Implement Isaac ROS GEMs for perception
4. Full Navigation Stack - Integrate Nav2 with Isaac Sim for complete navigation

Let's begin with [Chapter 1: Overview of NVIDIA Isaac Platform and Isaac Sim](./overview-of-nvidia-isaac).
