# Gazebo Simulation Examples

This directory contains practical examples for Gazebo simulation in the context of humanoid robotics.

## Available Examples

1. **Empty World Simulation** - Basic Gazebo environment with a ground plane
2. **Simple Robot in Gazebo** - Robot model with basic sensors
3. **Sensor-Equipped Humanoid** - Humanoid robot with LiDAR, cameras, and IMU in a furnished room

Each example demonstrates progressively more complex simulation scenarios for humanoid robotics applications.
