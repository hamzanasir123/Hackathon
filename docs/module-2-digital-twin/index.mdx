# Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

Welcome to Module 2 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics course. This module introduces you to digital twins for humanoid robots, focusing on physics simulation in Gazebo and high-fidelity visualization/human-robot interaction in Unity. You'll learn how to build and use digital twins that simulate realistic physics, sensors (LiDAR, depth cameras, IMUs), and environments to bridge simulation to real-world deployment.

## Overview

In this module, you will learn about:

- The concept of digital twins in Physical AI
- Why accurate physics simulation is critical for humanoid robotics
- How Gazebo serves as the physics engine and integrates with ROS 2
- Comparison with other simulators
- Using Unity for high-fidelity visualization and human-robot interaction

## Module Structure

This module is organized into three main chapters:

1. [Introduction to Robot Simulation and the Role of Digital Twins](./introduction-to-digital-twins) - Explains the concept of digital twins in Physical AI, why accurate physics simulation is critical for humanoid robotics, overview of Gazebo as the physics engine and its integration with ROS 2, comparison with other simulators, and introduction to Unity for visualization and HRI

2. [Mastering Gazebo Simulation](./mastering-gazebo-simulation) - Hands-on setup of Gazebo environments; working with SDF and advanced URDF for simulation; adding physics properties, collisions, and plugins; simulating core sensors: LiDAR, depth cameras, RGB cameras, and IMUs; creating complex worlds with obstacles, furniture, and dynamic elements

3. [High-Fidelity Rendering and Human-Robot Interaction with Unity](./unity-integration) - Integrating ROS 2 with Unity for real-time visualization; using Unity for photorealistic rendering and human-robot interaction scenarios; bridging Gazebo physics with Unity visuals via ros_tcp_connector or similar; designing interactive environments for testing natural interactions; best practices for multi-simulator workflows

:::note
This module builds upon the ROS 2 concepts learned in Module 1. Make sure you have a solid understanding of ROS 2 fundamentals before proceeding.
