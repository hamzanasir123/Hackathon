# Course Introduction: Why Physical AI Matters

Welcome to the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics capstone course! This introduction will help you understand the significance of embodied intelligence, what you'll learn, and how the course is structured over 13 weeks.

## Overview

Physical AI represents a paradigm shift from traditional digital AI to embodied intelligence that can interact with the physical world. This course combines four core modules (ROS 2, Simulation, AI-Brain, and Vision-Language-Action) to provide you with comprehensive knowledge and hands-on experience in humanoid robotics.

## Three Core Sections

This course introduction is organized into three main sections:

1. **[Why Physical AI Matters](./why-physical-ai-matters)** - Understanding the significance of transitioning from digital AI to embodied intelligence
2. **[Learning Outcomes](./learning-outcomes)** - Clear articulation of the 6 key learning outcomes you'll achieve
3. **[Weekly Breakdown](./weekly-breakdown)** - Detailed 13-week schedule mapping topics to core modules and capstone preparation
