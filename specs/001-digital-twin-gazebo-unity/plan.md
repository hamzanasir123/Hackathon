# Implementation Plan: Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

**Branch**: `001-digital-twin-gazebo-unity` | **Date**: 2025-12-18 | **Spec**: [specs/001-digital-twin-gazebo-unity/spec.md](specs/001-digital-twin-gazebo-unity/spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-digital-twin-gazebo-unity/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/sp.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Create Module 2 educational content covering digital twins using Gazebo and Unity for humanoid robotics. This includes three chapters: (1) Introduction to Robot Simulation and Digital Twins, (2) Mastering Gazebo Simulation, and (3) High-Fidelity Rendering and Human-Robot Interaction with Unity. The content will include hands-on tutorials, configuration examples, sensor simulation, and multi-simulator workflows.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Markdown, Python 3.10+, XML/YAML configuration files
**Primary Dependencies**: Docusaurus v3+, React/MDX, ROS 2 (Humble/Iron), Gazebo Harmonic, Unity (for simulation examples)
**Storage**: [N/A - documentation content]
**Testing**: [N/A - documentation content]
**Target Platform**: Web-based Docusaurus documentation site for GitHub Pages deployment
**Project Type**: documentation/web - educational content with code examples
**Performance Goals**: <200ms page load time, responsive design for educational content
**Constraints**: 5500-7500 words total across 3 chapters, alignment with ROS 2 Humble/Iron and Gazebo Harmonic standards
**Scale/Scope**: Educational module for AI/robotics students, 3 chapters with 5+ examples each

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

### Spec-driven development compliance
- [X] Specification exists and is complete before any implementation begins
- [X] Specification includes testable acceptance criteria
- [X] Specification aligns with user requirements

### Spec-Kit Plus workflow compliance
- [X] Follows /sp.specify → /sp.plan → /sp.tasks → /sp.implement sequence
- [X] All artifacts are properly linked and traceable
- [X] Workflow deviations are explicitly justified

### Reproducibility and traceability
- [X] All implementation steps can be traced back to specification
- [X] Plans link to relevant tasks and implementation
- [X] Complete audit trail exists for verification

### Quality and consistency
- [X] AI agent capabilities leveraged appropriately
- [X] Output meets established quality standards
- [X] Consistent formatting and terminology maintained

### Technical requirements
- [X] Technology stack aligns with constraints (Docusaurus v3+, React/MDX)
- [X] Deployment strategy supports GitHub Pages
- [X] Performance and accessibility requirements met

**Structure Decision**: Educational content will be organized as a Docusaurus module with 3 chapters as specified. Examples will be provided as downloadable configurations and code snippets that students can run in their ROS 2/Gazebo environments. Components will enhance the educational experience with interactive diagrams and code examples.

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
