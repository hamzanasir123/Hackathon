# Quickstart: Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

## Overview
This quickstart guide provides a high-level overview of Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity) educational content. It outlines the key components and how to get started with the module.

## Prerequisites
- Completion of Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)
- Basic Python programming experience
- Working ROS 2 Ubuntu environment (Humble/Iron)
- Familiarity with ROS 2 concepts (nodes, topics, services, actions)

## Module Structure
The module consists of 3 chapters that build upon each other:

1. **Chapter 1**: Introduction to Robot Simulation and the Role of Digital Twins
2. **Chapter 2**: Mastering Gazebo Simulation
3. **Chapter 3**: High-Fidelity Rendering and Human-Robot Interaction with Unity

## Getting Started

### 1. Chapter 1: Introduction to Robot Simulation and the Role of Digital Twins
- Learn the concept of digital twins in Physical AI
- Understand why accurate physics simulation is critical for humanoid robotics
- Get an overview of Gazebo as the physics engine and its integration with ROS 2
- Compare different simulators
- Introduction to Unity for visualization and human-robot interaction

### 2. Chapter 2: Mastering Gazebo Simulation
- Hands-on setup of Gazebo environments
- Working with SDF and advanced URDF for simulation
- Adding physics properties, collisions, and plugins
- Simulating core sensors: LiDAR, depth cameras, RGB cameras, and IMUs
- Creating complex worlds with obstacles, furniture, and dynamic elements

### 3. Chapter 3: High-Fidelity Rendering and Human-Robot Interaction with Unity
- Integrating ROS 2 with Unity for real-time visualization
- Using Unity for photorealistic rendering and human-robot interaction scenarios
- Bridging Gazebo physics with Unity visuals via ros_tcp_connector or similar
- Designing interactive environments for testing natural interactions
- Best practices for multi-simulator workflows

## Key Examples
The module includes 3 progressively complex Gazebo examples:
1. Empty world simulation
2. Simple robot in environment
3. Sensor-equipped humanoid in a furnished room

## Assessment
Each chapter includes:
- Clear learning objectives
- Practical step-by-step tutorials
- 5+ complete configuration/code examples
- Exercises to reinforce learning
- Troubleshooting tips for common issues

## Technical Requirements
- ROS 2 Humble/Iron
- Gazebo Harmonic
- Python 3.10+
- Docusaurus v3+ (for documentation site)
- Unity (for visualization examples, if available)

## Success Metrics
- Students complete Chapter 1 content with understanding of digital twin concepts
- Students successfully set up Gazebo simulation environments
- Students integrate ROS 2 with Unity for visualization
- Students create all 3 required Gazebo examples
- Content aligns with current ROS 2 and Gazebo standards
